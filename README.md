### Create an Heroku app
Register on [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) and create you app where you will upload repository you just have cloned. Heroku will build and run the project so you may have an accesible server that will handle all commands triggered from slack channels.

Install Heroku
`brew install heroku/brew/heroku`(on macOS)
For other OS check this [link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)

Login into your Herokue account
`heroku login`

cd to the root cloned repository folder and deploy proyect into heroku using the name you just put when creating Heroku App.
`heroku git:remote -a your_heroku_app_name_here`

Add some space in the code and commit to push into Heroku
````
git add .
git commit -am "make it better"
git push heroku master
```

Server is ready to handle slack commands. You may go to your slack workspace and type commands!

After launching a command go and check into you Factorial account if Signing is beign registered so check that everything is working.
